# Given a binary array data, return the minimum number of swaps required to
# group all 1â€™s present in the array together in any place in the array.

# Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:
# [1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
# [0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.
# [0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.
# The minimum is 1


# To count min swap of 1s, we can count total 1s in array, 
# then we can maintain a window of total1s size and calculate max ones in any such window.
# our swap count will be total ones - max ones in a window
#Time : O(n), space O(1)

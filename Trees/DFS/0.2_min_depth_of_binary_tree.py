# Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
# The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.
# Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

# Approach 3: BFS Iteration
# The drawback of the DFS approach in this case is that all nodes should be visited to ensure that the minimum depth would be found.
# Therefore, this results in a \mathcal{O}(N)O(N) complexity. One way to optimize the complexity is to use the BFS strategy.
# We iterate the tree level by level, and the first leaf we reach corresponds to the minimum depth. As a result, we do not need to iterate all nodes.
